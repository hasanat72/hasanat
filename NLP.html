			<h3>Natural Language Processing..</h3>
			<p style="width: 50%">Did you ever think why especially those adds you are seeing, while you looked for those items, or talked about with your friends in private cat groups five days back !! Nobody looked at it, right, then how do they know, which products you are looking or who are its potential buyers are !! this all is related to a field known as Data Science. As the progress through technological advancement and improvements in existing one we are becoming more prone to online shopping, selling and other services that don't require our physical presence, and at the same time we are giving a lot chunk of data, that has stored somewhere, that we are not aware of. Those every clicks and track of every single web page that we have visited are being stored somewhere and are being used in the behavioral analysis of yours, that's why it's pretty obvious that Google knows you much better than anyone else.</p>

			<h3>Blockchain</h3>
			<p style="width: 50%">Block Chain is nothing but an updated and upgraded faster way of money transaction media. Basically, it's an open ledger, on which everyone who owns the virtual money i.e- bitcoin could be a potential member and can transfer their capital to another person. You may ask me, why not giving the role to a bank. The simple reason behind this, as I said earlier it is much faster and charges less than the conventional any transaction media. Well, Now the question arises how it works. As its an open ledger, so the parties who are on the network can see everyone's capital and can see whether a transaction is valid or not. Whenever anyone exchanges money a data has been added to the open ledger as a means of record to keep track of the transaction.If you are trying to exchange more than your capital, the system won't add it to the ledger. Well,  as it seems preety close to Bank, but there is the significant difference of Block chain, instead of a centralized ledger, all the nodes or parties into the network holds the same open ledger. And whenever a transaction takes place, all the ledgers get updated instantly. But there is a catch who rings the bell, who is the first one to update the ledger. This is one of the special features of Block chain, Here comes the term miners. Whenever any node wants to tranject money, it sets a unvalidated ledger, then other nodes get notified and they tries to take the ledger and add it to theri ledger so as to make the ledger updated all across the network.And offcourse here is a monetary reward. Who did the update first as a miner, gets the financial incentive. But to make it happen a miner needs a unique key to lock the transaction into the ledger. And lastly to update the ledgers in all other nodes, respective nodes get the transaction and checks whether its validate or not,if its validated and they cant get reward for it, then they just update their own ledger. Thats how the whole system works.</p>
